## Description

Welcome to Group 4's repository. The application we chose to extend is Sakura Flashcards.

Sakura Flashcards is an open-source web application developed in the React framework to help users learn the primary writing systems used in the Japanese language (Hiragana, Katana, Kanji). The application was developed with various web development tools including NextJS, Vercel, TypeScript, React, Tailwind, Framer Motion, and React Icons. The application is inspired by Quizlet, using flashcard exercises to help users recognize Japanese characters, words, and phrases. The material contains Genki I and II sets which compile multiple lessons of flashcards. Users interact with the application by first choosing a lesson set, choosing a lesson, and practicing with the flashcards. During a lesson, flashcards appear on the screen, each displaying a character, word, or phrase in Japanese. The answer can be revealed by clicking on the card. The user must use self-assessment to evaluate their understanding. The target users for this application are hobbyists and lifelong learners looking to reinforce or expand their repertoire of Japanese reading/speaking.
